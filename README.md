## üì¶ Installation

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites / Considerations
- **For multi-battery devices (ex t480, etc)**: It can only set all batteries to the same threshold-s-, using a different one for each battery is not supported, since this is the case i've decided to promote it as "for single battery devices only" as i don't consider it feature-complete, but it technically works, it's just that the same threshold gets applied to all batteries (i think this is also a limitation in Vantage itself so whatever).
- **Lenovo Power Manager driver**: Make sure you have the official Lenovo Power Manager driver installed (check if PowerMgr.exe is running).
- **PowerShell**: Ensure PowerShell is working on your system.
- **64bit Windows**: Current release is x64 only, for 32bit you can build it manually or just run as a python script.

### üîΩ Download & Install

1. **Download the latest version** from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/santiagosantos08/RLCL/releases/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

   **OR**

3. **Build from source** (instructions below).

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

RLCL is a simple **GUI** for an official Lenovo CLI tool.

- Lenovo's ChargeThreshold CLI:  
  [ChargeThreshold.exe](https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs//thinkvantage_en/metroapps/Vantage/ChargeThreshold/ChargeThreshold.exe)

- The tool will be automatically downloaded during installation, or you'll need to provide your own if you build it from source.

- The app is built using **Python** and packaged into an `.exe` using **PyInstaller**.

- The installer is created using **Inno Setup** and manages desktop shortcuts, launch at boot, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/santiagosantos08/RLCL
cd RLCL
```
### 2. Install required Python packages
```
pip install pillow pystray pyinstaller
```
(pyinstaller only required if you want to bundle it to an .exe, running as a script is also fine, if that's the case, you are done here, just run rlcl.py with python, make sure to put Lenovo's "ChargeThreshold.exe" in the same dir, i can't redistribute it, that's why it needs to be downloaded at setup. It is linked above in the 'how it works' section.)
### 3. Build the executable
```
pyinstaller rlcl.spec
```
- This will create an `.exe`.
- The executable will look for **ChargeThreshold.exe** (the official Lenovo CLI) in the same directory, provide your own, linked above.

### 4. Extras
If you also want to build the installer, just get [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and compile `rlcl_installer.iss` with it.

If you don't want to build the installer, take in to consideration:

By default, the binary installer will install to:  
`C:\Program Files\RedLine\ChargeLimits`

But you can do as you like, as long as the CLI is in the same dir.

If you build it from source, you can figure out how to make it launch at boot :D.
